Turbo Trainer

Track your turbo trainer use and try to make it more interesting. Select your workout time, intervals, pick a video and off you go.


IDEAS
=====
* It could play me clips of the tour de France or other inspirational videos.

* I could tell it I'm interested in ruby programming and it could show a random video from confreaks.

* At the end of the work out the app would would store my session and I could comment on how it went. I could choose to automatically share this on twitter / facebook as a motivator.

* I could also challenge friends with turbo trainers over a one off distance race or a 3 week tour and see who has the fastest time over that period. Winner gets a virtual yellow jersey to laud over their friends.

* Ghost rider - animated picture of rider heading for finish line.

* Tele-promptwer so rider can read web pages / twitter / rss feed / email as they are riding.

* Email links to a personal turbo trainer email address which saves them for later use before you get on the turbo trainer.

* Weekly/monthly reports, graphs.

* Warm up / warm down times.

* When you end a session it remembers where you are in video an asks next time you login if you want to continue where you left off.
